#### Preliminaries

WORKDIR /

# Create some directories.
# Binaries run inside the sandbox live here.
RUN mkdir -p /bundle/rootfs/binaries
# The worker binary and related files live here.
RUN mkdir app
# The module being analyzed is unzipped here.
# The sandbox mounts this directory.
RUN mkdir module

#### Building binaries

# Set the working directory outside $GOPATH to ensure module mode is enabled.
WORKDIR /src

# Copy go.mods and go.sums into the container.
# If they don't change, which is the common case, then docker can
# cache these COPYs and the subsequent RUN.
COPY go.mod go.sum checks.bash ./

# Copy the repo from local machine into Docker clientâ€™s current working
# directory, so that we can use it to build the binary.
# See .dockerignore at the repo root for excluded files.
COPY . /src

# Download the dependencies.
RUN go mod download

# Build the worker binary and put it in /app.
RUN go build -mod=readonly -o /app/worker ./cmd/worker

# Build the program that runs vulncheck inside the sandbox and install it in the sandbox's
# binaries directory.
RUN go build -mod=readonly -o /bundle/rootfs/binaries/vulncheck_sandbox ./cmd/vulncheck_sandbox

# Build the sandbox runner program and put it in the bundle root.
RUN go build -mod=readonly -o /bundle/rootfs/runner ./internal/sandbox/runner.go

#### Sandbox setup

# Install runsc.
ADD https://storage.googleapis.com/gvisor/releases/release/20221107.0/x86_64/runsc /usr/local/bin/
RUN chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/runsc

# Set up for runsc.
# runsc expects a directory called a "bundle" that contains a config.json
# file and an OS filesystem.

# Create the runsc bundle.
WORKDIR /bundle
COPY config.json .

# go-image.tar.gz is a complete Docker image of a Go installation in tar format.
# Use it for the bundle's OS filesystem.
COPY go-image.tar.gz .
RUN tar --same-owner -pxzf go-image.tar.gz -C rootfs

# Copy the downloaded copy of the vuln DB into the bundle root.
COPY go-vulndb rootfs/go-vulndb

#### Worker setup
